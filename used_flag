      (op::Datum::pose), i.e. the scale of the (x,y) coordinates that will be
      saved with the `write_pose` & `write_pose_json` flags. Select `0` to
      scale it to the original source resolution, `1` to scale it to the net
      output size (set with `net_resolution`), `2` to scale it to the final
      output size (set with  `resolution`), `3` to scale it in the range [0,1],
      and 4 for range [-1,1]. Non related with `num_scales` and `scale_gap`.)

    --part_to_show: Select the prediction channel to visualize (default: 0). 0 to visualize all the body parts, 1-18 for each body part heat map, 19 for the background heat map, 20 for all the body part heat maps together, 21 for all the PAFs, 22-69 for each body part pair PAF.
